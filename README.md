# The Hundred
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) CSS Theme inspired by the cricketing format ['The Hundred'](https://www.thehundred.com). The colour of each team is represented in the headings when viewing in preview mode. All headings are white in edit mode to reduce distractions when writing.

I haven't completely made up my mind on the preview mode heading colours. If you use this theme, I'd like to know whether you think it's too much. Similarly, please also let me know if you like it.

Light theme is intentionally unsupported and I have no intention of adding it. Please feel free to fork this repo if you wish to add a light theme.

## Licence
Re-use/edit as you wish. Attribution appreciated but not necessary.

### Attribution
I don't consider myself a CSS developer. I know enough to get the things done that I need/want. So this theme contains a few snippets from those more talented in the CSS arena than I am in the Obsidian community. To acknowledge them, I wanted to put this attribution section high up this page, rather than buried at the bottom. 

Unless otherwise stated, all references originate from the Obsidian forum.

- auto fades status bar - **rsdimitrov**
- Add quotation character before quote - **Thery**
- bigger link popup preview - **_ph**
- outliner for the outline - **Shamama**
- list relationship lines - **Obsidian forum** (this appears in a lot of places, it's difficult to identify the original author).
